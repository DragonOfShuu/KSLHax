Load a page, and allow the user to enter a new page range.
Maybe allow a maximum number of cars at a time.

New Idea:
You can load a fixed number of pages, 
but it will only show you three cars 
at a time. By pressing arrows, you can
progress through the cars.
This will be done by sorting all the 
cars by the score given, and then the
GUI can go 3 cars at a time.
This way, only 3 cars will render and 
be saved at a time, and the GUI can
just sift through the raw saved data.
